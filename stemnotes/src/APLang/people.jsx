              This story describes a group of people who have spent their entire
              lives chained to rocks inside of a cave. The only thing they can
              see is the wall in front of them. Behind them is a fire and
              between the fire and the people is a walkway where people walk by
              holding objects. The people in the cave can only see the shadows
              of the objects on the wall in front of them. One day, one of the
              people is freed and sees the objects and the fire. He is then
              taken outside of the cave and sees the sun and the world for the
              first time. He then goes back into the cave to tell the others
              about the world outside of the cave. The people in the cave do not
              believe him and think he is crazy.

              <br />
              The shadows are the prisoners 'reality', even though they are not
              accurate to the real world. The shadows represent the 'false'
              reality that we see through our senses, while the lit up objects
              represent the true reality that people cannot see.

              <br />
              Plato uses this story to show that people are inherently biased
              and they percieve things based off how they grew up and stuff

              Glaucon and Socrates are having a discussion about justice.
              <br />
              <br />
              The reading begins with a discussion between Socrates and Glaucon
              about justice. Glaucon describes 3 types of good:
              <li>good that we do because we like the outcome</li>
              <li>
                good that we do because we like doing it and we like what the
                outcome is
              </li>
              <li>
                good that we do because we like doing it, regardless of the
                outcome
              </li>
              Socrates agrees with option 2 while Glaucon agrees with option 3.
              <br />
              <br />
              This reading is about a shepherd who found a ring on the corpse of
              a guy inside a bronze horse. He takes the ring and finds out that
              it can turn him invisible/visible to those around him. After
              discovering this power, he went as a kings messanger, cheated on
              the king with his wife, and the two of them planned and killed the
              king. The shepherd then ruled the land with the kings wife.
              <br />
              <br />
              Glaucon uses this story to show that even just men, when given the
              power to do so, will turn against justice, proving that people are
              not 'willingly just' and immideately become unjust when they have
              no consequences to their actions.
              <br />
              <br />
              Socrates disagrees with Glaucon and says that people are just for
              the sake of being just, not because they are afraid of the
              consequences.
